The British monarchy is the longest and popular existing monarchies in the world. On the passing day of the Her majesty, social media traction went through the rough as people from all over the world shared their views either positive or negative. Personally, I wanted to review the tweets and performed a sentiment analysis on them.

Some of the things I looked out for during the project are:

1. Most popular hashtags
2. Common words used in tweets
3. The twitter usersâ€™ perceptions

These questions and many more are what this analysis are aimed at. Through the use of Python and a one page report using Power BI, the analysis was successful. You can check out the meduim article here. 

The project strategy is shown below
